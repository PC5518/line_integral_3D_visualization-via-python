## ðŸ“ˆ Bonus: Line Integral Visualization

This project also includes a bonus figure showing a **line integral of a scalar field** along a curve on the surface \( z = f(x, y) \).

![Line Integral Visualization](./line_integral_visualization.png)

### What It Shows:
for example :
- The **surface**: \( z = x^2 + y^2 \)
- The **path**: \( y = x^2 \) from \( x = -1 \) to \( x = 1 \)
- The **line integral** lifts the path onto the surface and accumulates \( f(x, y) \cdot ds \)

This helps you understand whatâ€™s really happening when you do:
\[
\int_C f(x, y) \, ds
\]

It's like walking along a curve and **accumulating height** â€” a concept that's often abstract until visualized like this.
